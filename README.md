# Docker-Express-Mongo Container

## Project goal

I wanted a bootstrap project for my contractor & personal work, I usually go with python-django. But as of late, I felt in love with node-express-mongo, so for science and fun I decided to bootstrap an express-app with docker and the required boilerplate to make it work close to something like Django


## Usage

* Just set up your .env file following env-example
* docker-compose up
* Then docker-compose exec app npm install to avoid os specific binaries mix up
* Check docker-compose and env variables everything is pretty much self-explanatory
* Nodemon is available for dev & Forever can be run in prod
